DESCRIPTION
  
  In its simplistic use, the IO::LockedFile class gives us the same 
  interface of the IO::File class to files with the unique difference
  that those files are locked using the flock mechanism. Yet, the
  class provides us with the ability to use other schemes then flock.
  
  Example for the use of the class:

     use IO::LockedFile;

     # create new locked file object. $file will hold a file handle.
     # if the file is already locked, the method will not return until the
     # file is unlocked
     my $file = new IO::LockedFile(">locked1.txt");

     # when we close the file - it become unlocked.
     $file->close();

PREREQUISITES

INSTALLATION

  Follow the standard installation procedure for Perl modules, which is to
  type the following commands:

          perl Makefile.PL
          make
          make test
          make install

  You'll probably need to do the last as root.
